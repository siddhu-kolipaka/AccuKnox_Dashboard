# React + Vite Project for AccuKnox

1. A JSON in widgetdata.js is created to build this dashboard/widget dynamically.
2. Users can dynamically add and remove a widget from a section/ category.
3. Once the user clicks on +Add Widget, the user should select the category tab, and at the bottom section, add the Widget name, and widget text, and it will be added to that category.
4. On each widget, there is a cross icon to remove it from a category or users can go to the add category section and remove it from the category list.
5. Users can search in a list of all the widgets using the search bar.
6. All the overflows of data are properly taken care of.
7. The graph data can be added later based on other factors. Since it is given that we can only add widget title and widget text, we cannot send in other details from the user to put it in a graph. Hence I have left them empty. This can be changed on further discussion.
8. I have used context API for store management of states and other functions.
